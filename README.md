This project is a website whose function is to showcase a range of different audio solutions, from earphones,headphones to speakers.With aim of selling them right from the website.

The website is operational and all its functionalities are working well. These are such as choosing diffenrt types of audio devices, adding them to cart,where you can choose the quatity of devices you want, being directed to the checkout where you see your total charge and finally placing your order.

For installation Use git, Github and any editor or IDE to see the codes and the rendered frontend.

Creation of this project I used HTMl for markup, CSS and bootstrap for styling the page and javascript and Jquery for functionality.
